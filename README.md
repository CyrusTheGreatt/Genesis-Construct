# Genesis-Construct
A simple message encoder/decoder that is practically uncrackable. 

You put what you want to encode/decode in the big square and you put the "Password" to decode/encode. The password can affect what sort of message you get. 

-x-EXAMPLE-X-

If i try to encrypt the sentence "Cyrus is God" with the password "Invocation" the encrypted message is T3V5O5R5P5K2F5P5K2X3L5A5. 

Meanwhile, if i try to encrypt the same sentence with the password "invocation" (Note it is not capitalized) the encrypted message is Z4B7U6X6V6Q3L6V6Q3D5R6G6. 

THE PASSWORD IS CASE SENSITIVE. DO NOT FORGET THAT.
